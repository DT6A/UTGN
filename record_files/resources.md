# Data

* [Protein Structure Prediction Center](http://predictioncenter.org/)
    * initiates the CASP experiments to challenge researchers to predict protein structures.
    * contains data on proteins. Contains PDB files.

* [CAMEO](https://www.cameo3d.org/)
    * a place for evaluating the accuracy of protein predictions

* [Dunbrack Lab](http://dunbrack.fccc.edu/PISCES.php)
    * great for getting a list of PDB IDs with certain conditions (like within a resolution cutoff)

* [RCSB](https://www.rcsb.org/#Subcategory-download_structures)
    * for downloading PDB files

# Biology Web Servers For Predictions

* [RaptorX](http://raptorx.uchicago.edu/)
    * predict protein structures and functions

* [JPred 4](http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/jpred/)
    * predicts secondary structure from PDB sequence

* [CONFOLD](http://protein.rnet.missouri.edu/confold/)
    * predict protein coordinates with contact map, amino acid sequence, and secondary structure






# Programs

* [CNS Solve](http://cns-online.org/v1.3/)
